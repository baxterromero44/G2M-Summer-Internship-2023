# G2M-Summer-Internship-2023
In this repository please find work done for my 2023 Summer Internship with G2M Insights.

Over the course of 8 weeks I worked with industry grade Machine Learning platforms to compare our tool Analyzr to their top competitors.
In order to fully understand how to create good machine learning models. I first started from scratch creating ML models using SciKit and PandasPD libraries.
Once I had a basis and good understanding of how the models and their outputs worked for propensity. I started figuring out how to digest the results of my data in order to provide valueable insights from them.

After this project I hopped on client work for the company and built dyanmic data cleaning scripts to make it easier to upload CSVs into Snowflake DBs.
**All code provided in these files is my own however they will not run as I am unable to upload the datasets or csv files I used because it would violate G2Ms Data Security Policies**
